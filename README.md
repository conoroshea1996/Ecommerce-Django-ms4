# Django Ecommerce
A project that use both django and ajax to create a basic  ecommerce application.
My goals for this project were to gain a better understanding of django but also how to interact with the backend using more advanced frontend methods such as ajax. I feel that through this prject I have gained a better understanding of javascript and django.
